        <p class="container-heading heading1">Chicken</p>
        <p class="content">
          simple Indian chicken curry is made in the style common to the hamlets
          in Konkan, along the west coast of India. Using bone-in chicken lends
          the meat a richer, gamey flavor that's in keeping with how this dish
          was traditionally made, using free-roaming birds. A heavy hand with
          spices, including turmeric, coriander, cumin, and cinnamon, plus
          plenty of chili, leaves this dish intensely flavorful and fiery. Serve
          it over white rice or with bhakris (a type of unleavened rice bread)
          to soak up all the sauce.

          beef, flesh of mature cattle, as distinguished from veal, the flesh of
          calves. The best beef is obtained from early maturing, special beef
          breeds. High-quality beef has firm, velvety, fine-grained lean, bright
          red in colour and well-marbled. The fat is smooth, creamy white, and
          well distributed. In young beef the bones are soft, porous, and red;
          the less desirable mature beef has hard white bones. Beef tenderness
          and flavour are improved by aging;
